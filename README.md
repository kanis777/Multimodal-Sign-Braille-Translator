# Multimodal-Sign-Braille-Translator
Developed a Flask-based web app that accepts speech, text, or image input and converts it to Indian Sign Language (ISL) using GIFs/images and to Braille using Unicode characters. Integrated Whisper and Google Speech APIs, EasyOCR, language detection, translation, and grammar correction for inclusive accessibility.
